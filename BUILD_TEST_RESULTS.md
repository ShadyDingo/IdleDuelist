## 🔍 **KEY FINDINGS**

### **1. Balanced Offense + Defense > Pure Offense**
- **Bruiser** (99.7%) beats **Pure Attack** (46%)
- Having some defense makes you much more durable
- 200 HP + 15 defense >> 100 HP + 5 defense

### **2. HP Stacking is Very Strong**
- **HP Tank** with 500 HP has 89.2% win rate
- Massive HP pool outlasts most builds
- Only really loses to Bruiser (more balanced stats)

### **3. Speed/Dodge Builds Underperform**
- **Speed Demon** (24.3%) and **Dodge Tank** (43.1%) are weak
- Despite high dodge %, not enough damage to win
- Doesn't compensate for lack of HP/defense

### **4. Pure Attack is Mediocre**
- **Pure Attack** has only 46% win rate
- Glass cannon without the speed/crit to burst
- Needs defense or HP to survive

### **5. Spell Power is Currently Useless**
- **Spell Caster** has 0% win rate
- Spell power doesn't affect basic attacks in simulation
- Would need ability damage to be viable

### **6. Critical Strike Needs Support Stats**
- **Crit Build** (31.4%) doesn't perform well alone
- Needs attack power AND crit chance together
- **Glass Cannon** does this better (55 attack + 30% crit)

### **7. Balanced Builds are Viable**
- **Balanced** has 62.8% win rate
- Not the best, but solid all-around
- Good for beginners

## 📈 **STAT VALUE ANALYSIS**

**Most Valuable Stats (by win rate impact):**
1. **Attack Power** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
   - Core stat for all top builds
   - 2 damage per point is very efficient
   
2. **Max HP** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
   - Second most important
   - HP Tank proves 400+ HP is game-winning
   
3. **Defense** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
   - Good value in moderation
   - 10-15 points optimal
   
4. **Crit Chance** ⭐⭐⭐
   - Good with high attack
   - Diminishing returns above 20 points
   
5. **Speed** ⭐⭐
   - Useful for dodge chance
   - Not worth heavy investment
   
6. **Spell Power** ⭐
   - Currently useless (no ability damage)
   - Would need system rework

---

## 🎯 **OPTIMAL STAT RATIOS**

Based on top performers:

**40% Attack / 30% Defense+HP / 30% Utility (Crit/Speed)**
- Example: Bruiser (40% attack, 40% defense/HP, 20% crit)

**OR**

**20% Attack / 80% HP**
- Example: HP Tank (10% attack, 10% defense, 80% HP)

**Avoid:**
- Pure offensive (no defense/HP)
- Pure defensive (no attack)
- Heavy speed investment
- Any spell power (until abilities implemented)

---

## 🔧 **BALANCE RECOMMENDATIONS**

To improve build diversity:

1. **Nerf Bruiser slightly**
   - Maybe cap defense effectiveness
   - Or reduce crit damage multiplier

2. **Buff Speed/Dodge**
   - Increase dodge value
   - Add speed-based damage bonus

3. **Implement Spell Power**
   - Make abilities scale with spell power
   - Give spell casters viability

4. **Adjust Defense Scaling**
   - Pure defense tank is too weak
   - HP stacking is too strong
   - Balance the two

5. **Crit Needs Help**
   - Pure crit build is weak
   - Maybe increase crit damage multiplier
   - Or add crit-based effects

---
