# Mobile App Fixes Summary

## 🐛 **Issues Fixed**

### 1. **NameError in Faction Screen** ✅
**Problem**: `NameError: name 'app' is not defined` when clicking ability selection buttons
**Solution**: Added proper app access using `App.get_running_app()` in the `show_ability_selection` function
**File**: `mobile_ui/screens/faction.py`

### 2. **Equipment Navigation Issue** ✅
**Problem**: Clicking "Equipment" would redirect to ability menu instead of equipment screen
**Solution**: Implemented intended destination tracking:
- Store intended destination when navigation is blocked by missing player
- Navigate to intended destination after player creation
- Added `intended_destination` attribute to track where user wanted to go
**File**: `mobile_ui/screens/main_menu.py`

### 3. **Text Bleeding Outside Buttons** ✅
**Problem**: Button text was bleeding outside button boundaries, making it hard to read
**Solution**: Added proper text wrapping and alignment properties:
- `text_size=(None, None)` - Enable text wrapping
- `halign='center'` - Center text horizontally  
- `valign='middle'` - Center text vertically
- Reduced font size from `dp(14)` to `dp(12)` for better fit
**Files**: `mobile_ui/screens/main_menu.py`, `mobile_ui/screens/equipment.py`

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **Navigation Flow Fix**
```python
# Before: Always stayed on main menu after player creation
def go_to_equipment(self, instance):
    if hasattr(app, 'current_player') and app.current_player:
        self.manager.current = 'equipment'
    else:
        self.show_new_player_popup(instance)  # Lost intended destination

# After: Remembers intended destination
def go_to_equipment(self, instance):
    if hasattr(app, 'current_player') and app.current_player:
        self.manager.current = 'equipment'
    else:
        self.intended_destination = 'equipment'  # Store destination
        self.show_new_player_popup(instance)

# After player creation, navigate to intended destination
self.manager.current = self.intended_destination
```

### **Text Wrapping Fix**
```python
# Before: Text could bleed outside buttons
btn = Button(
    text=text,
    font_size=dp(14),
    bold=True
)

# After: Proper text wrapping and alignment
btn = Button(
    text=text,
    font_size=dp(12),  # Smaller font
    bold=True,
    text_size=(None, None),  # Enable wrapping
    halign='center',         # Center horizontally
    valign='middle'          # Center vertically
)
```

### **App Access Fix**
```python
# Before: Undefined app variable
abilities = app.faction_manager.get_faction_abilities(self.current_player.faction)

# After: Proper app access
from kivy.app import App
app = App.get_running_app()
abilities = app.faction_manager.get_faction_abilities(self.current_player.faction)
```
