# Mobile Export Guide for Idle Duelist

## Current Status
Your game is fully functional and ready for mobile export! Here are the available options:

## Option 1: Use Google Colab (Recommended)
Since Buildozer doesn't work well on Windows, the best approach is to use Google Colab:

### Steps:
1. **Upload your project to Google Drive:**
   - Zip your entire `IdleDuelist` folder
   - Upload it to Google Drive

2. **Use this Colab notebook:**
   ```python
   # Mount Google Drive
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')

   # Install buildozer
   !pip install buildozer

   # Navigate to your project
   %cd /content/drive/MyDrive/IdleDuelist

   # Build APK
   !buildozer android debug
   ```

3. **Download the APK:**
   - The APK will be created in `bin/` folder
   - Download it to your phone and install

## Option 2: Use WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
If you have WSL2 installed:

1. **Install Ubuntu in WSL2**
2. **Install buildozer in WSL2:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3-pip
   pip3 install buildozer
   ```
3. **Copy your project to WSL2**
4. **Build the APK:**
   ```bash
   buildozer android debug
   ```

## Option 3: Use GitHub Actions (Automated)
Create a GitHub repository and use automated builds:

1. **Create `.github/workflows/build.yml`:**
   ```yaml
   name: Build APK
   on: [push]
   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
       - uses: actions/checkout@v2
       - name: Build APK
         run: |
           pip install buildozer
           buildozer android debug
       - name: Upload APK
         uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
         with:
           name: app-debug.apk
           path: bin/app-debug.apk
   ```

## Option 4: Use Online Build Services
- **PythonAnywhere** (if they support buildozer)
- **Replit** (with Linux environment)
- **Gitpod** (cloud-based development)
