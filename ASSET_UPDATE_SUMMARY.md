## 🔧 **Technical Updates Made**

### **Asset Manager Updates:**
1. **Updated naming convention** to handle new armor slot names:
   - `chest` → `armor`
   - `legs` → `pants`
   - `helmet`, `boots`, `gloves` remain the same

2. **Added slot mapping** in `get_armor_image()` method to automatically convert old slot names to new ones

3. **Case-insensitive extension support** for all image types (.png, .PNG, .jpg, .JPG, etc.)

### **Equipment System Updates:**
1. **New stat ranges** implemented correctly:
   - Normal: 5-10 (regular), 1-3 (percentage)
   - Uncommon: 5-15 (regular), 1-4 (percentage)
   - Rare: 10-20 (regular), 2-5 (percentage)
   - Epic: 10-25 (regular), 2-6 (percentage)
   - Legendary: 20-40 (regular), 4-8 (percentage)
   - Mythic: 25-50 (regular), 5-10 (percentage)

2. **Equipment naming** follows format: `(rarity) (item) of (primary affix)`

3. **Full equipment management** with visual popup interface

## 🎮 **What You Can Now Test**

### **Desktop App (`desktop_app_with_equipment.py`):**
1. **Create Player** - See faction images
2. **View Stats** - See all UI icons for stats
3. **Manage Equipment** - Full equipment management popup with:

## 📊 **Asset Status Summary**
- **Total Assets**: 58 available
- **Missing Assets**: 0 (all complete!)
- **Asset Categories**: 6/6 complete
- **Naming Convention**: Updated and working

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Test the apps** - Both desktop and mobile versions are ready
2. **Border overlay issue** - If rarity borders still don't cover equipment properly, you may need to:
   - Make borders slightly larger than equipment images
   - Ensure borders have proper transparency
   - Center borders over equipment images

3. **Deploy to mobile** - Use `buildozer android debug` to create APK for testing
