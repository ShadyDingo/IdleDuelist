# Music Setup Guide

## Supported Music Formats
The game supports the following audio formats:
- MP3 (.mp3)
- WAV (.wav) 
- OGG (.ogg)

## Required Music Files
Place your music files in the `music/` folder with these exact names:

### Background Music
- `background.mp3` (or .wav/.ogg)
- Plays during main menu, loadout, and leaderboard screens
- Should be a calm, ambient track suitable for menus

### Combat Music  
- `combat.mp3` (or .wav/.ogg)
- Plays during duels/combat
- Should be more intense/action-oriented

## How to Add Music
1. Convert your music files to MP3, WAV, or OGG format
2. Rename them to `background.mp3` and `combat.mp3` (or appropriate extension)
3. Place them in the `music/` folder
4. Launch the game - music will automatically start playing

## Audio Controls
- **Volume Slider**: Adjust music volume from 0% to 100%
- **Mute Button**: Toggle between ðŸ”Š (unmuted) and ðŸ”‡ (muted)
- Controls are available on the main menu

## Notes
- Music files are optional - the game works fine without them
- If no music files are found, the audio controls will still be available but won't do anything
- Music automatically loops during gameplay
- Combat music takes priority over background music during duels
