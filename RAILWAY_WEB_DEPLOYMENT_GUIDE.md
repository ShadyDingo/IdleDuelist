# 🚀 Railway Web Deployment Guide

## 🎯 **Get Your IdleDuelist Web Game Live!**

Your Railway deployment is working, but it's currently serving the API backend instead of the web interface. Let's fix that!

---

## 🔧 **Quick Fix - Update Railway Deployment**

### **Step 1: Update Your Repository**
The files I just created need to be pushed to your GitHub repository:

1. **Procfile** - Tells Railway to run the web server
2. **requirements.txt** - Lists the dependencies
3. **railway.json** - Railway configuration
4. **simple_web_server.py** - Updated with proper port handling

### **Step 2: Push to GitHub**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add web interface deployment files"
git push origin main
```

### **Step 3: Railway Auto-Deploy**
Railway will automatically detect the changes and redeploy your app!

After the web version is live, you can:
- **Monitor usage** in Railway dashboard
- **Add more features** to the web version
- **Integrate with your mobile app** using the same backend
- **Scale up** if you get lots of players

**The web version is perfect for testing, sharing, and getting feedback before investing in mobile app store deployment!** 🚀
