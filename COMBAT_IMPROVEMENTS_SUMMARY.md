# Combat System Improvements - Idle Duelist

## 🎯 **Issues Fixed**

### ✅ **1. Sequential Turn Display**
**Problem**: Combat showed both players' moves simultaneously in each turn.

**Solution**: Modified combat to show each player's move one at a time:
- **Turn 1**: Player 1 moves → Player 2 moves
- **Turn 2**: Player 1 moves → Player 2 moves
- And so on...

**Technical Changes**:
- Added `turn_order_set`, `current_turn_player`, and `turn_number` tracking
- Modified `simulate_combat_turn()` to handle one player at a time
- Added `get_opponent()` helper method
- Proper turn sequencing with 1-second delays between actions

### ✅ **2. Ability Icons in Combat**
**Problem**: Ability icons weren't showing up in combat logs.

**Solution**: Added visual ability icons to combat actions:
- **Divine Strike**: ⚔️
- **Shield of Faith**: 🛡️
- **Healing Light**: ✨
- **Righteous Fury**: 🔥
- **Shadow Strike**: 🗡️
- **Shadow Clone**: 👥
- **Vanish**: 👻
- **Assassinate**: 💀
- **Nature's Wrath**: 🌿
- **Thorn Barrier**: 🌵
- **Wild Growth**: 🌱
- **Spirit Form**: 👻

**Technical Changes**:
- Added `get_ability_icon()` method with icon mapping
- Modified `log_combat_action()` to include ability icons
- Added `current_ability` tracking in `execute_turn()`
- Enhanced combat log with turn headers and HP status

## 🎮 **New Combat Experience**

### **Before**:
```
Turn 1: Player1 attacks Player2 for 15 damage!
Turn 1: Player2 attacks Player1 for 12 damage!
```

### **After**:
```
--- Turn 1 ---
Player1 uses ⚔️ Divine Strike on Player2 for 15 damage!
Player2's HP: 85/100

Player2 uses 🗡️ Shadow Strike on Player1 for 12 damage!
Player1's HP: 88/100

--- Turn 2 ---
Player1 uses 🛡️ Shield of Faith on Player2 for 8 damage!
Player2's HP: 77/100
...
```

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Key Methods Modified**:
1. **`simulate_combat_turn()`** - Sequential turn handling
2. **`log_combat_action()`** - Enhanced with icons and formatting
3. **`execute_turn()`** - Added ability tracking
4. **`start_combat()`** - Added state reset
5. **`get_ability_icon()`** - New icon mapping method
6. **`get_opponent()`** - Helper method for opponent lookup

### **State Management**:
- `turn_order_set`: Tracks if turn order is determined
- `current_turn_player`: Current player taking action
- `turn_number`: Current turn number
- `current_ability`: Ability being used (stored on player)
